### Present and Present continuous
- get vs become
Get/become + adjective = growth or development of some sort
  As I get older I get more optimistic. = As I become older I become more optimistic.
Become + noun = development or change
  She became a nun. != She got a nun.
Get + noun/pronoun = ‘obtain’, ‘fetch’, ‘receive’ or ‘acquire’.
  I got a call from Betty

- When we say "I promise to do". We don't say "I'm promising to do" however we are in the middle of the process of promising.
  apologise, suggest, advise, insist, agree, refuse.

- I always do and I'm always doing
  I always do (something) = I do it every time: I always travel on foot.
  I'm always doing (something) = I do it more often than normal, too much: I've lost my phone. I'm always losing my phone.

- Don't use with continuous:
  Like, want, need, prefer, know, realise, belong, fit, suppose, mean, understand, believe, remember, contain, consist, seem
  see, hear, smell, taste

### Present perfect
- When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now. A period of time from the past that continues until now.
When we say that 'something has happened', this is usually new information.
  He has Lost his key = He lost it recently, and he still doesn't have it
  He has gone to Italy = he is there now or on his way there
  She has been to Italy = she has now come back
  He has been out = he went out but he's not out now
  It's the (nth) time something has happened. Not the (nth) time happens.
  Have you ever visited = Have you ever been to
- The main point is the result of activity.
- Yet = until now. It is probably more common in questions.
  Have you finished your sandwich yet? - Yes, I've already finished
- In question "Already" has essentially the same meaning as "yet" but might indicate some surprise.
  Have you already finished your sandwich?
  I just gave it to you and you have finished it so quickly.
### Present perfect continuous
- We use it for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped. There is a connection with now.
  Paul is very tired. He's been working very hard. (= he's tired now)
- The activity might not be stopped but when we mean the part of it until now.
  It has been raining for two hours (it might still raining)
- For actions repeated over a period of time.
  She's been playing since she was eight
### Present perfect vs Present perfect continuous
- Perfect Continuous is about the activity. Perfect is about the result of activity.
- Perfect Continuous + How long. Perfect + how much, how many.
- Simplification of 'been'
  it's been a long time since/for == it's a long time since/for
### Present perfect vs Present simple
- Use Past Simple for things that are not recent or new. Use Present Perfect for the contrary.
- During the conversation the new information is not new anymore, so you are ought to use past simple.
  Ow! I've burnt myself. How did you do that? (not have you done) I picked up (not have picked up) a hot dish.
- What do you think of my English? Do you think it has improved?
- My grandfather died before I was born. I never met him.
  I don't know Jane. I've never met her.

### Past perfect
- The same as Present Perfect but instead of 'now' there is some point of time in the past. So, if smth happened before that point and we want to emphasize that we use Past Perfect.
  Kate wasn't at home when I phoned. vs. Kate had just got home when I phoned.
  ### Past perfect
- The same mechanism to change as in Present Perfect -> Past Perfect.
  It wasn't raining when we went out. But it had been raining, so the ground was wet.

### Have vs Have got
- Have = Have got for possession, relationship, illness. In my opinion 'I've got' is appropriate when you possess smth since some time and want to emphasize that now. This equivalence does not work for the past. "I'd got" is not used.
  I have a headache = I've got a headache

### Present tense for future
- I'm doing something (in future) = I have already decided and arranged to do it
  What are you doing on Saturday evening? (not What do you do)
- The present continuous is more natural when we talk about arrangements. Do not use **will** to talk about what you have arranged to do.
  What are you doing this evening? (not What will you do)
- You can also use the present continuous for an action just before you begin to do it. This happens especially with verbs of movement.
  I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
- We use the present simple when we talk about timetables, programmes etc. (for public transport, cinemas etc.)
  My train leaves at 11.30
  What time does the film start this evening?
- You can use the present simple to talk about people if their plans are fixed like a timetable.

- I'm going to do something = I've decided to do it (but perhaps not arranged to do it). Often the difference is very small and either form is possible.

  He is going to walk into the wall. (cause he is going right into it and does not look forward)
- I was going to do something = I intended to do it, but didn't do it
  I thought it was going to rain, but it didn't

### Will/shall
- We use **I'll(= I will)** when we've just decided to do something. When we say 'I'll do something', we announce our decision. Do not use will to talk about what you decided before (=going to...).

  I'm for a minute, I won't stay long
  Will you please turn the music down?
- You can use won't to say that somebody refuses to do something

- **Shall** is used mostly in questions. Usually we ask for an opinion. Normally we use **shall** only with **I** and **we**.
